# face_recognition_attendance_system
The face is one of the easiest ways to distinguish the individual identity of each other. Hence, we have proposed an automated student attendance system based on face recognition. Face recognition system is very useful in life applications especially in security control systems. In our proposed approach, firstly, video framing is performed by activating the camera through a user-friendly interface. The face is detected and segmented from the video frame by using “Haar Cascade classifier”. In the pre-processing stage, scaling of the size of images is performed, if necessary, in order to prevent loss of information. In our proposed approach, the enhanced local binary pattern outperforms the original LBP by reducing the illumination effect and increasing the recognition rate. Finally, the attendance of the recognized student will be marked and saved in the excel file. The student who is not registered will also be able to register on the spot.
